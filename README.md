# Modelling-Cygnus-X-1

Here the focus is on the corona models and specifically Cygnus X-1 (an X-ray Binary) hard state with “magnetic corona”. The thermal electron distribution is in terms of momentum because for typical coronal temperatures there will be both sub-relativistic particles as well as relativistic. We assume emission from a spherical corona with total electron energy density in equipartition with the magnetic energy density. Assume an accretion disk emitting a blackbody from its inner edge. We calculate the self-absorbed synchrotron and SSC within the corona, as well as inverse Compton up-scattering of the disk blackbody.
